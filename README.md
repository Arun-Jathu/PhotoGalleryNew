# Photo Gallery App

The Photo Gallery App is a modern, responsive web application built with React and Redux, designed to display and manage a collection of photos. It fetches photo data from a public API (JSONPlaceholder) and allows users to browse photos in a grid view, view detailed information about each photo, and add/edit descriptions for photos. The app features a sleek dark theme, consistent design across all interfaces, and a focus on usability and accessibility.

## Features

- **Photo Grid View**: Browse photos in a responsive grid layout with search and pagination functionality.
- **Photo Details View**: View detailed information about each photo, including metadata and related photos from the same album.
- **Description Editing**: Add and edit descriptions for photos directly from both the Gallery and Photo Details pages, with data persisted in `localStorage`.
- **Consistent Design**: Modern dark theme with teal accents, consistent card designs, and hover effects across all interfaces.

- **Accessibility**: Keyboard navigation, focus states for interactive elements, and screen reader support.
