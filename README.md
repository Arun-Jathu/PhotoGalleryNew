# Photo Gallery App

The Photo Gallery App is a modern, responsive web application built with React and Redux, designed to display and manage a collection of photos. It fetches photo data from a public API (JSONPlaceholder) and allows users to browse photos in a grid view, view detailed information about each photo, and add/edit descriptions for photos. The app features a sleek dark theme, consistent design across all interfaces, and a focus on usability and accessibility.
